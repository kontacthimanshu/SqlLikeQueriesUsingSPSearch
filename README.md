# SqlLikeQueriesUsingSPSearch
The objective is this project is to build a JavaScript library that can parse sql like queries and execute them using SharePoint search on large SharePoint lists representing real world related entities.

Large lists in SharePoint online become tricky to deal with when they are representing related real world entities because of SharePoint's software boundaries such as list view threshold, lookup column threshold, where clause not working in CAML queries when SharePoint list is large, user experience requirements not meeting when trying to use metadata navigation etc. The problem is more involved because the feature (AttachmentAccessor) to read child records as attachment to master record is not available for SharePoint lists. The project proposes a search based approach to execute complex queries involving joins on such related entities. While searching it is possible to fetch data for a particular list by using out of the box "Path" managed property. And data from related child entity (list) can be fetched by establishing relationship by adding lookup type fields on identity (ID) field of parent entity (list) in child entity (list). The data can be fetched by issuing multiple parallel AJAX calls and be synchronized and joined on web browser client by using jQuery deferred objects.
